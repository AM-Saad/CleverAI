- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Inline Examples** - SM-2 examples within algorithm section

**Verdict**: ✅ **Archive is SUPERSEDED** - Main doc is more comprehensive and better organized

---

### 2. SM2_ALGORITHM_EXAMPLES.md Analysis

#### Status: **VALUABLE STANDALONE CONTENT**

**Content**: 
- 2 detailed walk-through examples with step-by-step calculations
- Concrete numbers showing algorithm behavior
- "Key Insights" summary at end

**Overlap with Main Doc**:
- Main doc has similar examples (lines 122-182)
- But **LESS DETAILED** than archive version

**Comparison**:

| Aspect | Main Doc Examples | Archive Examples |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Detail Level | High | **Very High** |
| Step-by-Step | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes with code blocks |
| State Tracking | ✅ Before/After | ✅ Complete state history |
| Calculations | ✅ Shown | ✅ **Annotated with reasoning** |
| Use Case | Inline learning | **Deep dive reference** |

**Example Comparison**:

**Main Doc** (lines 122-142):
```markdown
#### **Review #1 (Today)**
- **Before**: `repetitions: 0, easeFactor: 2.5, interval: 0`
- **Grade**: `2` (Hard - incorrect)
- **Calculation**:
  ```typescript
  repetitions = 0        // Reset (stays 0)
  intervalDays = 1       // Always 1 day for incorrect
  easeFactor = 2.5 - 0.32 = 2.18  // Gets harder
  ```
- **Result**: Review **tomorrow** (1 day)
```

**Archive** (lines 19-31):
```markdown
### **Review #1 (Today)**
- **State Before**: `repetitions: 0, easeFactor: 2.5, interval: 0`
- **Your Grade**: `2` (Hard - you got it wrong, difficult to recall)
- **Calculation**:
  ```typescript
  // Grade 2 = incorrect response
  repetitions = 0        // Reset (stays 0)
  intervalDays = 1       // Always 1 day for incorrect
  easeFactor = 2.5 - 0.32 = 2.18  // Gets harder
  ```
- **Result**: Review again **tomorrow** (1 day)
- **New State**: `repetitions: 0, easeFactor: 2.18, interval: 1`
```

**Difference**: Archive includes "New State" tracking and more conversational tone

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **KEEP AS REFERENCE** - Provides deeper educational value for understanding algorithm

### 3. SPACED_REPETITION_DEBUG_CONTROLS.md Analysis

#### Status: **PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED**

**Content Breakdown**:

| Section | Lines | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Overview | 1-9 | ✅ Superseded | Main doc covers this |
| Implementation Details | 11-50 | ⚠️ Historical | Files/locations documented |
| Debug Controls Available | 52-60 | ✅ Superseded | Main doc lines 389-401 |
| Preset Scenarios | 62-68 | ✅ Superseded | Main doc lines 403-410 |
| Debug Functions | 70-76 | ✅ Superseded | Main doc lines 412-418 |
| **What Each Action Does** | 78-120 | ⚠️ **VALUABLE** | **More detailed than main doc** |
| **Apply BEFORE/AFTER Grading** | 122-154 | ⚠️ **VALUABLE** | **Unique guidance not in main** |
| **Interval Days vs Next Review Date** | 156-178 | ⚠️ **VALUABLE** | **Important clarification** |
| Usage Instructions | 180-216 | ✅ Superseded | Main doc covers workflow |
| Technical Implementation | 218-243 | ⚠️ Historical | Implementation details |
| Security Features | 245-281 | ✅ Superseded | Main doc mentions dev-only |

**Unique Valuable Content**:

1. **Detailed Action Explanations** (lines 78-120)
   - What "Apply Values" actually does to database
   - What "Reset" does vs doesn't do
   - What "Load Presets" does
   
2. **Timing Guidance** (lines 122-154)
   - When to apply debug values BEFORE grading (testing algorithm)
   - When to apply AFTER grading (edge cases)
   - Why timing matters
   
3. **Interval vs Date Relationship** (lines 156-178)
   - Explains `intervalDays` vs `nextReviewAt` interaction
   - Common confusion point addressed
   - Recommendations for different test scenarios

**Main Doc Coverage**:
- Lines 367-444 cover debug controls
- **But less detailed on WHY and WHEN**
- Focuses on HOW, not conceptual understanding

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY MERGE** - Extract unique conceptual explanations into main doc, archive rest as historical implementation notes

---

### 4. test-review-workflow.md Analysis

#### Status: **FULLY SUPERSEDED**

**Content**: 78 lines of E2E test workflow

## 📋 Consolidation Recommendations

### ✅ Action 1: Add Superseded Notice to SPACED_REPETITION_README.md

**Reason**: Main doc is more comprehensive and up-to-date

**Notice to add** (at top of file):
```markdown
> ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED**: This document has been replaced by [SPACED_REPETITION.md](../SPACED_REPETITION.md)
> 
> **Why archived**: The main documentation is more comprehensive, better organized, and includes:
> - Complete debug controls documentation
> - Comprehensive testing workflows  
> - Performance & analytics section
> - Troubleshooting guide
> 
> **Historical value**: This document provides detailed service architecture explanations and component integration examples.
> 
> *Last updated: September 2025 → Archived: October 2025*
```

---

### ⚠️ Action 2: Preserve SM2_ALGORITHM_EXAMPLES.md

**Reason**: Provides deeper educational value than main doc examples

**Recommendation**: **KEEP AS IS** with clarifying notice

**Notice to add**:
```markdown
> 📚 **Educational Reference**: This document provides detailed step-by-step SM-2 algorithm examples.
> 
> **Relationship to main docs**: While [SPACED_REPETITION.md](../SPACED_REPETITION.md) includes inline examples, 
> this document offers more detailed explanations and complete state tracking throughout the learning process.
> 
> **Use case**: Reference this when you need deep understanding of algorithm behavior with specific numbers.
> 
> *Educational supplement - not superseded*
```

---

### ⚠️ Action 3: Extract & Merge Debug Control Concepts

**From**: SPACED_REPETITION_DEBUG_CONTROLS.md  
**To**: SPACED_REPETITION.md (Debug Controls section)

**Content to extract**:

1. **"What Each Action Does"** section (lines 78-120)
   - Add detailed explanations of Apply/Reset/Load Presets
   - Include database impact notes
   
2. **"Apply BEFORE/AFTER Grading"** section (lines 122-154)
   - Add timing guidance subsection
   - Explain when to use each approach
   
3. **"Interval Days vs Next Review Date"** section (lines 156-178)
   - Add clarification box about relationship
   - Include recommendations for test scenarios

**Then add superseded notice**:
```markdown
> ⚠️ **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ARCHIVED**: Core debug concepts have been merged into [SPACED_REPETITION.md](../SPACED_REPETITION.md)
> 
> **Still useful for**: Implementation details, file locations, technical architecture of debug system
> 
> **Superseded content**: Usage instructions, workflow guidance (now in main doc)
> 
> *Implementation guide - partially archived: October 2025*
```

---

### ✅ Action 4: Delete test-review-workflow.md

**Reason**: Fully superseded by main doc testing section

**Justification**:
- No unique content
- Main doc has MORE information
- No historical value (testing hasn't changed)

**Alternative**: If keeping for historical reasons, add:
```markdown
> ⚠️ **FULLY SUPERSEDED**: This workflow is now documented in [SPACED_REPETITION.md - Testing Workflows](../SPACED_REPETITION.md#testing-workflows)
> 
> The main documentation includes:
> - ✅ All steps from this document
> - ✅ Additional performance checks
> - ✅ Browser compatibility matrix
> - ✅ Error scenarios testing
> - ✅ Algorithm validation procedures
> 
> *Archived: October 2025*
```
