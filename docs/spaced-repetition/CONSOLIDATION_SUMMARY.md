## 🔧 Changes Executed

### 1. Main Documentation Enhancements

#### ✅ Fixed Grade Scale Inconsistency (High Priority)
**Issue**: Documentation showed "1-6" but code implements "0-5"

**Changes**:
- Updated all grade references from "1-6" to "0-5" throughout SPACED_REPETITION.md
- Corrected grading table to show grades 0-5 with accurate descriptions
- Fixed keyboard shortcut documentation (was "1-6", now "0-5")
- Updated API reference grade parameter comments

**Impact**: Eliminates confusion between docs and actual implementation

**Files modified**:
- `SPACED_REPETITION.md` (4 occurrences fixed)

---

#### ✅ Added Missing API Documentation (High Priority)
**Issue**: `GET /api/review/enrollment-status` endpoint undocumented but actively used

**Changes**:
- Added complete API Reference section for enrollment-status endpoint
- Documented request/response format with examples
- Explained use case (bulk enrollment checking for UI lists)
- Added note about polymorphic resource support (materials + flashcards)

**Impact**: Developers now have complete API documentation

**Content added**: ~40 lines in API Reference section

---

#### ✅ Added Domain Architecture Documentation (High Priority)
**Issue**: Entire `app/domain/sr/` layer (5 files, ~300 lines) completely undocumented

**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive "System Architecture" section with layered diagram
- Documented all domain components:
  - **SREngine**: Business logic orchestrator
  - **SRScheduler**: SM-2 algorithm implementation (strategy pattern)
  - **SRPolicy**: Configuration and defaults
  - **CardReviewRepository**: Repository pattern for data access
  - **SRTypes**: Domain type definitions
- Explained Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture benefits
- Added data flow diagram showing domain layer interaction
- Updated component tree to include domain layer

**Impact**: Developers understand the sophisticated architecture pattern used

**Content added**: ~150 lines of architecture documentation

---

#### ✅ Enhanced Debug Controls Documentation (Medium Priority)
**Issue**: Debug control concepts lacked detailed explanations

**Changes** (merged from archive):
- Added "What Each Action Does" with database impact details
- Added "When to Apply Debug Values" section with BEFORE/AFTER guidance
- Added "Interval Days vs Next Review Date" relationship explanation
- Enhanced with recommendations for different testing scenarios

**Impact**: Users understand how to effectively use debug tools for testing

**Content added**: ~100 lines of conceptual debug guidance

---

#### ✅ Fixed Schema Documentation (Medium Priority)
**Issue**: Documented schema showed non-existent fields (`enrolledAt`, `totalReviews`)

**Changes**:
- Replaced SQL-style schema with actual Prisma schema
- Added all real fields: `cardId`, `resourceType`, `folderId`, `lastGrade`
- Documented polymorphic design (supports materials AND flashcards)
- Added schema indexes for query optimization
- Removed fictitious `ReviewHistory` table

**Impact**: Schema documentation matches actual implementation

---

#### ✅ Clarified Component Architecture (Low Priority)
**Issue**: DebugPanel.vue listed as separate component but integrated into CardReviewInterface

**Changes**:
- Updated component tree to show debug panel as integrated
- Clarified in file listing that it's part of CardReviewInterface.vue
- Updated architecture diagram

**Impact**: Accurate representation of actual file structure

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Thorough Discovery**: Found undocumented domain layer (5 files!)
2. **Validation First**: 92% accuracy baseline gave confidence
3. **Zero Loss**: All unique content preserved or enhanced
4. **Clear Notices**: Archive organization much clearer now
5. **Educational Value**: Kept detailed algorithm examples as reference

### Process Improvements from Notifications
1. ✅ Better initial validation (92% vs 88%)
2. ✅ More careful about deleting vs archiving
3. ✅ Added "educational reference" category for valuable supplemental docs
4. ✅ Enhanced rather than replaced where appropriate

### Unique Challenges
1. **Grade Scale Subtlety**: Both systems had 6 levels, just different numbering (0-5 vs 1-6)
2. **Domain Layer**: Entire architecture layer undocumented - required understanding DDD pattern
3. **Debug Concepts**: Scattered across implementation doc, needed consolidation and enhancement
4. **Polymorphic Design**: Material/Flashcard support not clearly explained

### For Ongoing Maintenance
1. **Keep main doc updated** as features are added
2. **Update domain architecture** if patterns change
3. **Maintain grade scale consistency** (0-5) in all new docs
4. **Add new API endpoints** to reference immediately
5. **Consider versioning** if major algorithm changes occur

### For Other Categories
- Apply same validation methodology
- Look for undocumented architecture layers
- Preserve educational supplements
