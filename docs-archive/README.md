## üéØ Usage of Archived Files

### **When to Reference Archived Files**

1. **Historical Context**: Understanding how features evolved
2. **Detailed Examples**: Some archives contain more detailed examples
3. **Migration Reference**: If you need to see previous implementation details
4. **Audit Trail**: For understanding why certain decisions were made

### **Archive Organization**

Files are organized by domain and roughly in chronological order of creation. The largest files (PWA_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md, COMPREHENSIVE_TIMING_TEST_SCENARIOS.md, etc.) were the primary sources for the consolidated documentation.
